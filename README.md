# Deck-of-Cards-Game
This is a cards game code. The game's instructions are as follows:
Consider a deck of cards with N different playing cards equally distributed among M suits. For example, a standard deck of card has M=4 suits with N=13cards for each suite. You draw all the cards without putting any back. After the first card, each time you pick a card, you compare it to the previous card. If the suits match, you get a point. Otherwise, you get no point.
